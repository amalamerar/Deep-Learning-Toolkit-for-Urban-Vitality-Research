# Deep-Learning-Toolkit-for-Urban-Vitality-Research
This Excel-based toolkit helps urban researchers integrate deep learning (DL) into urban vitality studies. It is particularly relevant for work in and on Global South cities but can be used by researchers in any context. The toolkit provides step-by-step guidance on selecting models, data types, and research strategies.
